To run, you need two terminal instances. They can be on the same computer, or two different computers. One player runs ./battleship server. This player will recieve a port number for the other player to use. The other player runs./battleship client localhost <portNumber>. The computers will connect, and the game will run. If running on a different computer, player 2 would run ./battleship client <computerName> <portNumber>. Make sure to expand your terminal to full size, to ensure the game environment is drawn correctly. ex:

Same Computer:
Player 1: ./battleship server
          Starting server...
          Server listening on port 35469

Player 2: ./battleship client localhost 35469

Different Computers:
Player 1 <kleene>: ./battleship server
          Starting server...
          Server listening on port 35469

Player 2: ./battleship client localhost <kleene> 35469


To start the game, follow the instructions on screen. 

Enjoy, have fun, and sink those ships!
